 *      This is a low-overhead clock that trades away accuracy for better
 *  performance. The main use-case is for high-frequency operations where you
 *  really don't want to call into the system clock which might go all the way
 *  into the kernel for something like the HPET.
 * 
 *  This clock will drift over time by as much as 0.1%.
